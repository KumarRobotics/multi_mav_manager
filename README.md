# multi_mav_manager
=============
This is a multi MAV manager which leverages mav_manager and quadrotor_control 
for each agent.  It leverages CAPT for multi-agent planning to ensure there are
no collisions and provides additional formation functionalities.

Note: This is currently dependent on the feat/line_tracker_min_jerk_duration 
branch of quadrotor_control
